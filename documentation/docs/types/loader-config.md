# LoaderConfig Type

This document describes the `LoaderConfig` which defines the configuration for loaders used within the application.

## Type Definitions

### `LoaderName`

```typescript
type LoaderName = "";
```

This type defines the allowed names for loaders within the application. You can use other values different from the predefined names but you will need to define them in the `config` prop of the `<BetterHtmlProvider>` also. Check out the [Configuration](../getting-started/configuration#loaders-configuration) page for more details.
